IRIS CLASSIFICATION USING MACHINE LEARNING 
1. Problem Definition:
Define the problem you want to solve, whether it's classification, regression, or another task. For example, let's say you want to classify emails as spam or not spam.

2. Data Collection and Preprocessing:
Collect a labeled dataset containing features (characteristics of the data) and corresponding labels (the class you want to predict). Preprocess the data by handling missing values, scaling, and encoding categorical variables if necessary.

3. Data Splitting:
Split your dataset into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, and the testing set is used to evaluate its performance on unseen data.

4. Feature Selection:
Identify the relevant features that contribute to the predictive power of your model. This step is crucial for model efficiency and interpretability.

5. Model Selection:
Choose the appropriate classifiers for our IRIS classification problem. In this case, I'm uesd SVM, Logistic Regression, and KNN.
a. Support Vector Machines (SVM):
Theory: SVM finds a hyperplane that best separates data into classes while maximizing the margin between them.
Procedure:
 1.Identify support vectors (data points close to the decision boundary).
 2.Optimize the hyperplane to maximize the margin.
b. Logistic Regression:
Theory: Logistic Regression models the probability that an instance belongs to a particular class.
Procedure:
 1.Apply the logistic function to the linear combination of features.
 2,Train the model using a suitable optimization algorithm to find the optimal weights.
c. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):
Theory: KNN classifies a data point based on the majority class of its k-nearest neighbors.
Procedure:
 1.Calculate the distance between the test point and all training points.
 2.Identify the k-nearest neighbors.
 3.Assign the class based on the majority class among the neighbors.
6. Model Training:
Train each selected model using the training dataset.

7. Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the models using the testing dataset to assess their performance. Common metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

8. Hyperparameter Tuning:
Adjust hyperparameters of each model to improve performance. For example, in SVM, you might tune the kernel type and regularization parameter.

9. Model Deployment:
Once satisfied with a model's performance, deploy it to make predictions on new, unseen data.

10. Monitoring and Maintenance:
Continuously monitor the model's performance over time and update it as needed.

This step-by-step procedure provides a general framework for building and deploying any machine learning models.
The specifics may vary based on the nature of the problem and the characteristics of the dataset.
